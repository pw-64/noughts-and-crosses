# noughts-and-crosses
A tkinter gui based game of noughts and crosses. Currently it is you vs computer, but if I revisit this I might add player vs player.
The goal is to get three of your symbol in a row, column or diagonal by placing them on the grid.

## Installation & Usage
No dependencies are required to be installed, since python comes with tkinter built-in.
To run:
- Download & Unzip / Clone this repo
- `python3 main.py` in your shell of choice
